DESCRIPTION
    App::Smoke::In::A::Box is a standalone boxed CPAN Tester smoke
    environment. Built on CPANPLUS and CPANPLUS::YACSmoke it enables an
    individual to simply download this distribution, extract it somewhere,
    add their email address and optionally an email gateway to use and start
    CPAN Testing against an arbitary "perl" executable without worrying
    about the toolchain dependencies.

    It provides CPANPLUS and bundled modules required to bootstrap the CPAN
    Testing process.

    Included are:

      CPANPLUS + its prereqs

      CPANPLUS::YACSmoke

      YAML::Tiny

      Test::Reporter

      Sort::Versions

      Regexp::Assemble

      Config::IniFiles
